# VibeCoding Is Just Stupid.

## Why Is It Bad?
---

Here is Why First Things First, It's Just Shit. People Come Get AI-IDE's Then Just Start Abusing Ai To Write Thousand Lines Of Code When You Are Sitting There Doing Nothing, Then Later Say I Did Everything From Scratch is Just Bottom Line Stupidity. There Is No Knowledge Of Your's In That Code Apart From The Prompts Saying Do This Do That bruh.

Ai Code Editor's / Ai In Programming Sector Is Made To Use It As A "HELPER" Not Abuse It To Make App's. Use It To Slove Error's You Are Getting So That You Can Get More Info Out Of It If You Weren't Already Looking At The Terminal Logs. Use Ai For Help If You Are Not Getting Smtg About The Error Or The Code Or Make Some Programming Buddies And Help Out Each Other.

## CONS ONLY:
1. It's Stupid.
2. The Codebase Will Be Clutterd. {Not Organised}
3. Makes You Feel Like A "GOAT" For Sometime.
4. You'll Be Dead If Ai Is Dead.
5. Skips Planning, Architecture & Scalabilty.
6. Lead's To Wrong Insecure, Depricated Code.
7. Blank Face If Someone Ask's How This Works. {bruh}
8. BRAIN FRY {Certified Looser's}

## Moral: Don't VibeCode Use Your Brain's Idiot's

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Boycott VibeCoding, Be A Nerd");
    return 0;
}
