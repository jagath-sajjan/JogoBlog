# Dark matter, one of those mystrioues things in our universe.

## What is dark matter even?

Dark matter is that invisible cosmic fevicol holding the whole universe together. You can’t see it, can’t touch it, but it’s literally everywhere, making up most of the stuff out there while we just live on our tiny blue rock.

Dark matter is most of the mass in galaxies. We only make up about 5% of the universe. Dark matter is around 27%. The rest is dark energy, another mystery.

We can’t see dark matter, but it has mass and takes up space. It pulls on stars and galaxies, and that’s how we know it’s there. We see its effects, not the thing itself.

So the question is, if we can’t see it, what are we actually looking at that proves it exists?

## Study On Dark Matter:


Scientists now have stronger evidence for dark matter. Even though dark matter doesn’t interact with light, its gravity can bend light from far away galaxies. This bending is called gravitational lensing, and it helps us study where dark matter might be.

A key example is the Bullet Cluster, observed in 2006. It’s a huge collision of two galaxy clusters, about 3.8 billion light-years away. When scientists looked at it, they saw that most of the mass wasn’t in the hot gas we can detect, but in areas separated from it. Those areas are thought to be dark matter.

With evidence like this, scientists are trying to learn what dark matter is and how it is spread across the universe. Since dark matter helps hold everything together, mapping where it is can help us understand how the universe is built and how it has changed over time. Missions like NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will help create these maps.

In the Bullet Cluster image, pink shows normal matter and blue shows where dark matter is likely found. You can see that most of the mass is in the blue areas, which is a strong sign that dark matter is real.

## Temp Of Dark Matterr??

Dark matter has mass, so it should also have a temperature. Scientists looked at two ideas: cold dark matter (slow particles) and warm or hot dark matter (fast particles).

They ran simulations to see how the universe would form in each case. With cold, slow dark matter, galaxies form and stay together the way we see them. With warm or hot dark matter, things don’t hold together and the universe wouldn’t look like it does now.

So, the current view is that dark matter is most likely cold and slow-moving, forming early in the universe and helping galaxies take shape.

## Potential Dark Matter Candidatessss:

Scientists still don’t know what dark matter is made of. It might even be more than one kind of particle. Here are a few leading ideas:

WIMPs

WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) are heavy, slow particles that don’t interact with light. They could pass through normal matter without stopping. If two WIMPs destroy each other, they might produce gamma rays, so scientists have searched NASA’s Fermi telescope data for signs of this.

Axions

Axions are very light, low-energy particles first suggested in 1977 to solve a physics problem about why matter didn’t disappear when the universe began. Some scientists think axions could make up dark matter. Data from Fermi, Chandra, and NuSTAR telescopes has been used to search for hints of them.

Primordial Black Holes

These are hypothetical black holes that could have formed right after the universe began. They might be tiny or extremely massive. Some theories suggest they could be dark matter or that dark matter came from them. Scientists even use Fermi data to look for signs that these black holes might evaporate over time.
